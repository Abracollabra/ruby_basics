# In the code below, an array containing different types of pets is assigned to pets.

# LS solution follows

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

my_pet = pets[2]

puts "I have a pet #{my_pet}!"


# This was my tortured solution...

# pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

# def mine(pets)
#   arr = pets.select { |one| one == "fish" }
#   my_pet = arr.pop
#   puts "I have a pet #{my_pet}!"   
# end

# a = ["cat", "dog", "fish", "lizard"]

# mine(a)
